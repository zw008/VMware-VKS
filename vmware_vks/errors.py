"""Centralized error types with teaching hints (CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #37).

All REST (vCenter namespace-management) and Kubernetes (Supervisor / TKC)
failures are translated into VksApiError at the connection layer, so users
and agents see actionable guidance instead of raw tracebacks.

Everything this skill raises deliberately derives from :class:`VksError`, and
that is the single entry the MCP layer's ``_safe_error`` allowlists. Raising a
bare ``RuntimeError`` for an authored message silently discards it — the agent
sees ``"RuntimeError: operation failed."`` instead.
