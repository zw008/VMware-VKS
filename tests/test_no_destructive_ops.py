"""Safety boundary tests — destructive CLI commands must have confirm guards.

The guard lives in the CLI command layer (which owns the interactive
confirmation flow), not in ops/ — ops functions are also invoked by the
MCP server, where confirmation is the agent's responsibility (confirmed=
False preview gates) and a blocking prompt would hang the stdio transport.

History: this file originally asserted _double_confirm inside ops/ functions —
the wrong layer — so it failed permanently while telling us nothing.
Rewritten 2026-06-08 (family-wide pass; same fix as VMware-Aria/NSX).
