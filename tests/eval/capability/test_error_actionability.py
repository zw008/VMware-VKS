"""Capability — when a call fails, is the model told enough to fix it?

What this measures
------------------
CLAUDE.md mandates "教学性错误" (teaching errors): an error must not merely
report a failure, it must carry the correction. This eval extracts every error
message the package can raise — by parsing the AST, so it sees messages no test
happens to trigger — and scores each on three dimensions. It also checks the
live MCP error payload shape.

Why it matters for a small model
--------------------------------
Error recovery is where the capability gap between a large and a small model is
widest. Given ``VM 'web-99' not found``, a large model recovers on its own: it
infers that names come from an inventory call, finds one in the tool list, calls
it, and retries with a corrected name. A small model does none of that. It
either surfaces the raw error to the user as a dead end, or — the failure mode
issue #31 actually reported — smooths it over into a confident, wrong summary.

The difference between those two outcomes is entirely in the message text.
``VM 'web-99' not found. Run vmware-monitor's list_virtual_machines (filter by
name, e.g. 'web-99*') to see available VMs and copy an exact name.`` converts
recovery from an inference
problem into an instruction-following problem, which is precisely the thing weak
models remain good at. Every point scored here moves one more failure across
that line.

The three dimensions
--------------------
``names_input``    — the message interpolates the offending value, or states the
                     valid range/set it violated. Without this the model cannot
                     tell which of several arguments was wrong.
``states_remedy``  — an actionable instruction ("run", "check", "set", "copy an
                     exact name"), not just a diagnosis.
``names_artifact`` — names the specific tool, CLI command, env var, or file to
                     act on. This is what makes the remedy executable rather
                     than aspirational; a model told to "verify connectivity"
                     without being told *how* will invent a command. Tool names
                     are matched against the live registry, so pointing at a
                     tool that does not exist scores zero — a remedy the model
                     cannot carry out is not a remedy. Naming a companion
                     skill's CLI does count: a documented hand-off is followable.

How to read the score
---------------------
A 0–100 index over all raise sites × three dimensions. **>70** most failures are
self-correcting for a weak model; **50–70** the common paths teach and the long
tail does not; **<50** errors are mostly dead ends. ``names_input`` is usually
near-saturated because f-strings make it nearly free — the signal lives in
``states_remedy`` and ``names_artifact``, so read those per-dimension figures
before the aggregate.

The ``dead_end_errors`` list in the detail block is the actionable output of this
whole file: those are the exact messages to rewrite next, in priority order.
