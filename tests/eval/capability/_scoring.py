"""Scoring primitives shared by this skill's capability evals.

Why this exists
---------------
A regression eval answers a yes/no question ("does bug #31 still bite?") and
must sit at 100%. A capability eval answers a *how well* question ("can a small
model actually drive this tool surface?") and is expected to sit below 100%
forever — the number is the product, not the pass/fail.

So every capability eval here does two things:

1. **records a score** into ``_scores.json`` next to this file, so the next
   release can diff against it rather than re-deriving a feeling; and
2. **asserts a floor**, deliberately set well under the current score. The floor
   is a ratchet against collapse, not a quality bar. A test going red here means
   something fell off a cliff, not that the surface is imperfect.

Do not raise a floor to match a score. The floor's job is to stay boring.

Token estimation
----------------
``estimate_tokens`` is a BPE approximation (word/punct segmentation × 0.75), not
a real tokenizer — none of the family venvs carry ``tiktoken`` and a capability
eval must not add a dependency to be runnable. It lands within roughly ±15% of
cl100k on this kind of English-plus-JSON text, which is ample: every budget here
is a *trend* measurement compared against the same estimator in the previous
release, and against thresholds chosen with the error bar already in mind.
