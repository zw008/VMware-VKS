"""Every CLI command that performs a write is wrapped by @guarded (HLD I-1, I-8).

A write CLI command must route through vmware_policy's guard() + audit_call() —
the same enforcement @vmware_tool gives the MCP surface — so ``vmware-vks tkc
delete`` run through Bash is authorized and audited to ~/.vmware/audit.db exactly
like the ``delete_tkc_cluster`` MCP tool. Without @guarded a CLI write bypassed
policy and landed only in the legacy per-skill log (the gap HLD §2.1 documents).

The write set is DERIVED, never hand-listed (踩坑 #43): a tool annotated
``readOnlyHint=False`` is a write; the ops functions its body calls — reached by
a bare name OR ``module.func`` on an ops-module import — are the state-changing
ops; a CLI ``@command`` calling one is a write command and must carry @guarded.
The attribute-call case is not optional: the server tools reach ops as
``_ns.delete_namespace`` / ``_tkc.delete_tkc_cluster`` (module-alias attribute
calls) while cli.py imports the real names and calls them bare — a derivation
blind to either style would silently miss the whole write surface, the "label
promises more than content" shape.

VKS ships a single ``cli.py`` and a single ``mcp_server/server.py`` rather than
AIops's ``cli/`` and ``mcp_server/tools/`` packages; path-discovery below detects
either layout. Pointing rglob at a directory that does not exist would return
zero files and pass vacuously — the "empty results read as no problem" shape —
so the anti-vacuous asserts stay.
