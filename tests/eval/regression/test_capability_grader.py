"""Regression — the error-actionability grader must not credit phantom tools.

The ``names_artifact`` dimension used to match on the prefixes ``list_`` and
``get_``, which made it blind in both directions. It scored zero for real tools
named anything else (``cluster_info``, ``browse_datastore``, ``vm_info``), and
it scored full marks for names that do not exist — vmware-monitor shipped an
error telling the model to run ``list_vms``, a tool with no such name on the
surface, and the rubric called that a well-taught error.

That second half is the one worth a regression test. A grader that rewards
pointing at an imaginary tool actively selects for the failure it claims to
measure: the message reads as helpful, scores as helpful, and strands the model
on a call it cannot make.

These run against a fabricated tool list rather than the live registry on
purpose. The property under test is "only names actually on the surface count",
and passing the surface in explicitly is what makes that property visible —
against the real registry the test would drift every time a tool is added.
